# Before class
in general, taxable revenue and tax deductions are different that financial reporting revenue and expense
accelerated depreciation in taxable base determined by government

Gain(Loss) = Sales Price - (Gross PPE - AccDep)
           = AccDep - (Gross PPE - Sales Price)
           = AccDep - Economic Depreciation

Loss: we record too little depreciation 
Gain: we record too much depreciation

# Microsoft case
Why SEC investigating Microsoft?
Act reason: concerns over revenue recognition, expensing of software development
other: high profit, anti-trust, ...

on B/S: largest amounts are cash / securities invested, 
on Book: 37 = 9 + 28; in the market: 9 + 460 !
a lot of asset missing?


# R&D  rules
expensed rather than capitalized
software development & acquisition

71% of US software firms do not capitalize software development costs

# "Pro Forma" Capitalization
60% should be capitalized with 2 year useful life
R&D: x, y
0.6x : capitalizable costs on B/S
0.4x : expense

capitalized costs                | 0.6x |  0.6y        |
prior year cap costs             | -    |  0.3x        |
net software development asset   | 0.6x |  0.6y + 0.3x |

**question: if no y in second year: net software development asset becomes half, how to adjust in B/S?**

# Unearned Revenue
defer revenue / understate income
decrease income

# Incentive to hide profits
