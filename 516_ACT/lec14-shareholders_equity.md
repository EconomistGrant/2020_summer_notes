## Preferred Stock
preferences than common stock:
dividends, convertible, cumulative dividends (MUST be paid before common shareholders receive dividends)

VC: prefer convertible

## Hybrid
convertible debt
company could: get a reduced interest rate, giving bondholders the option to buy

amount of shares received = principal / conversion price
if stock price < conversion price: debt holder won't convert. Debtholders have a "threshold" value
otherwise: debtholders could gain from a rising stock price!

Twitter IPO Accounting
two ways:
Cash + Capitalized Issuance Csots = Common Stock at par + APIC
        (permanently on B/S) 
or Recude APIC for issuance costs

## Treasury Stocks
repurchase stock: 
company think it is undervalued; strategic, voting right; more EPS; tax reason, dividend has tax

reissue:
treasury stock contra-equity account is reduced
difference of reissue/purchase -> APIC

OCF: gain on early extinguishment of debt???

# EPS
EPS(basic)
EPS(diluted): adjust for options, convertible, preferred

diluted > basic if -net income since diluted base is larger than basic base

weighted shares outstanding:
go back and "pretend split start at the beginning"
weighted by fraction of the year

diluted:
Add-back to NI = convertible preferred dividends + after-tax convertible debt interst
- preferred dividends

diluted shares = shares of stock options and convertible assumed to convert

all converted
options: 
option shares - option shares * exercise price  / market price (proceeds used to buy shares for company)
