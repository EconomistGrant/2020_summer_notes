# statement of cash flows
Motivation: NI = CFO + Accruals
accruals reverse: high accruals, lower NI in the future

Buy low accrual stock (High CFO / Low NI): higher future NI
Sell high accrual stock(High NI/ Low CFO): lower future NI 
in practice: 10% per year

A = L + SE
delta A = delta L + delta SE

delta Cash = -delta non-cash Assets + delta L + delta SE

# Statement of Cash Flows: Three Sections
1. Operating, primary business activities
   - Selling goods or rendering services
2. Investing, acquiring and selling productive assets
   Acquisition and disposal of PPE
   Purchase/Sale of other firms' stock/debt
3. Financing, Related to external sources of financing
   issuing stock
   payment of dividend/debt

# Amazon
difference between Amazon CFO and Net Income: depr, stock-based compensation, operating assets/liabilities

increasing depr <- increasing PPE <- support company growth

stock-based compensation: +CC, -R/E as wage expense
working capital = current assets - current liabilities
non-cash working capital

# NI -> CFO
NI - Accruals 
add non cash expenses (depr.)
Add/Subtract Gain/Losses 
Add/Subtract changes in non-cash working capital accounts

NI
+Depr
+Stock Compensation
+Other
-Change in Working Capital (AR - AP, decreasing means source of cash, colleting A/P quiker, get in cash quicker)
= CFO

Growing short term liability faster than short term asset,
different from expected?
using its suppliers as source of cash?

Jeff Bezos: "Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows"
increasing operating income, efficiently managing working capital + cash capital expenditures

CFO - capital expenditures = Free cash flow
16.4B - 6.7B = 9.7B

negative: raise cash from debtholder and stockholder

question: does positive change in working capital basically means increase in A/R is faster than increase in A/P? how is this related to A/R collection & A/P payment period?
or essentially why increasing working capital -> working capital becomes a source of cash?

increase in A/R, havn't gone in cash???
