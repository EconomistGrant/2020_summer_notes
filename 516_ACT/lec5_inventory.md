# Inventory
Inventory Equation
LIFO vs FIFO, LIFO conformity rule
IFRS vs GAAP

# Accounting for inventory
choose the tires to match expense: LIFO or FIFO?

FIFO: old costs on I/S, new costs on B/S
LIFO: new costs on I/S, old costs on B/S

FIFO: more accurate B/S (falling prices, tech)
LIFO: more accurate I/S (rising price, use LIFO)

report lower profits for tax purpose

# US LIFO conformity rule
if use LIFO for US tax purposes, must use LIFO for financial reporting purposes

# IFRS vs Us GAAP not on exam
IFRS allows upward re-evaluation of PPE
development costs can be capitalized under IFRS, but expensed under US GAAP

why US firms use LIFO:
rising costs, taxable profits
LIFO use more accurate income statement

# LIFO to FIFO
adjustment are available for transfering from LIFO to FIFO
disclose the current costs ()

LIFO reserve 
= Engding INV_FIFO - Ending LIFO_FIFO
= COGS_LIFO - COGS_FIFP
(should be + for increasing prices)

I/S adjustment item: -LIFO reserve

Inventory Turnover = COGS / avrg.INV
FIFO: lower COGS, higher INV, much lower INV.TURN.
