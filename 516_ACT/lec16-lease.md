# Lease
the right to use property, plant, equipment for a stated period of time
new standard: operating leases on balance sheet

finance lease vs. operating lease

# Finance lease
cash    Lease Asset    -Acum.Amort     =  Lease Obligation    + S/E
          300,000                          300,000

(payment)                              (principal deduction)
-21795                                      -3795           -18000 (int. exp from lease obligation)
                          10000                             -10000 (Amort. expense)

                          

Asset is amortized straight line; Liability is decreased slower at the begining

## CF - Expense
cash flow: straight line;
expense: higher at the beginning (more interest exp.)

## footnote
how much money to pay for operating/finance leases

yr 1
   2
   3

   5
total minimum lease payments                x * P
minus: amounts representing interest        
PV of future minimum capital lease payment  PV  

# Operating Leases
intuition: maybe the life of plane is much greater than 30 years

simple leases: same payment each year, first payment at the end of year

1. straight line expense = total cost / number of payments
2. calculate "interest expense" on liability
3. "amortization expense" = straightline expense - interest expense

Cash            Lease Obligation
(21975)              (21795) 

    Lease Asset                     + RE
    (3795)            18000          (21795) (lease exp)

intuition: part of the decraesed obligation is interest that "shoud not be accounted and you need to add back?

or:

Cash       Lease Asset    =  Lease Obligation    +   R/E
(21975)       (3795)            (3795)              (21975) 
Asset decreased the same way as Liability

## Operating vs Finance
Operating: Lease Expense = Lease Payment
Finance: Interest Expense + Amortization expense != lease payment
