# Should Balance Sheet Value represent Market Value of Debt
debt riskier due to poor financial performance
interest rate up, value go down, increase discount
unrealized gain in OCI

Italy expansive borrowing/spending: rise in yield, drop in value
hurts banks, to avoid loss -> record as "held to maturity" rather than held for trading or available for sale

# Review
interest payment = principal * coupon
interst expense = market value * market rate
difference: amortize the premium
