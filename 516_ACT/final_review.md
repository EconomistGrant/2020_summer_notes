# Accrual Accounting
# Revenue Recognition
Earning process substantially complete
cash collection reasonably assured

Cash = Def. Rev + R/E(Revenue)

managers have discretion about the allocation of deferred revenue
iphone: worth of update

increase in NI: change in increase in BV (unearned rev, session 7)

reestimate ending balance after write-off, then adjust ADA with additional Bad Debt Expense

# Inventory
LIFO: recent, higher priced, high costs in COGS, low cost in inventory, save tax
FIFO: high in inventory, low in COGS, high income, physical flow of goods

 LIFO
+"estimated replacement cost"
= FIFO
Inv. Turnover higher for LIFO = COGS / Inv

COGS_FIFO = COGS - deltaFIFO_reserve
# PPE & Intangible
tax depreciation is accelerated, set by government

Management choice of depreciation/accruals has no effect on taxable income
LIFO/FIFO is the only exeption

Gain = Price - (Gross PPE - AccDep) = AccDep - (Gross PPE - Sale Price)
= Accounting Depr - Economic Depr
Gain: over depreciation

Accrual reverse: high accural this year -> low accrual, low income next year
Accrual = Net Income - Cash Flow from operation

# Cash FLow
NI + non cash expense + gain/loss with investing - change of working capital

# FIn analysis
Dupont: NI / SE = NI/S * Sale/A * A/SE
easiest: Sale/A

# Fin investment
Trading and Available for sale: <20%
trading: income statement "unrealized loss"
AFS: OthCI
record "marketable securities"

Equity Method: 20% - 50%
Do not mark to market value!
income: increase investment. dividend: decrease investment

owns 100%:
get rid of parent investment, subsidiary Equity, add on others
if subsidiary has higher leverage: increase parent

owns 60%:
get rid of parent investment (60% equity), subsidiary equity, additional 40% subsidiary equity as non-controlling interest

owns 49%: 
keep investment on Asset without expanding into L + SE

# Bond
Interest Expense = market rate * bond payable
Interest Payable = coupon rate * par amount

difference: amortized against bond discount (premium) account

Early retirement/repurchase bond
Cash = Bond Payable - Discount + RE
-10403 -11910     -1310         197(gain on retirement of bond)

interest rate go down: price go up, purchase -> loss
marking to market: "unrelized" gain/loss
# Stock Issurance
Capitalize issurance costs / reduce APIC issuance costs(typical)
if APIC close to cash received: capitalized (not decreased essentially)

# Lease and Taxes
advantages: tax advantage
operating lease: constant lease expense over time, = lease payment
finance lease: interest expense + amortization expense != lease payment
high expense at the begining and then decrease(high interest expense essentially)

comparison charts on session 16
## Financing Lease
lease payment - interest expense = principal deduction
amortization is straight line

cash  = lease obligation + r/e
-20         -14.9          -5.1(interest expense)
Accum Depreciation = R/E
+17                  -17 (depr expense)
 
## Operating lease
essentially set "amortization" = principal deduction
making sure lease expense = "interest expense" + "amortization" = payment
making sure lease asset = lease liability
Cash + Lease Asset = Lease Obligation + R/E
-20                   -20
        -14.9         +5.1(interest)     -20
                    net:principal payment
# Tax
book income != tax income
DTA are overvalued: valuation allowance
Effective Tax Rate = Income Tax Expense/ Pre-tax accounting earnings

current tax = cash taxes
provision for income tax = tax expense
deferred income tax benefit (increase in net asset) / provision (increase in net liability)

Tax - Book difference
200k asset, fully tax deductible, 4-year depreciation, T-B = 150k
Deferred Tax Liability = 150k * 0.25 = 37.5
DTL: taxable income is lower, depreciation in tax is more

Get tax depreciation - GAAP depreciation thru DTL / tax rate

tax rate up to 35%: adjust DTL based on T-B
