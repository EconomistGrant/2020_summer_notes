# The Role of Estimates
customer does not pay: expense that should be matched to revenues
bad debt expense

# Apollo's business model
Joe not paying bills: reduce receivables on B/S
record an expense on I/S

accrual accounting says the "bad debt expenses" should be matched to the date of revenue

# Two methods of estimation
percentage of sales method
aging method: based on the age of the receivables (longer, less likely)

## Percentage of sales
revenue expenses
4% allowance expense 

colection (real collected ammount, -cash, -A/R)
write off (real defaul amount, -A/R, -Allowance)

as a result, A/R will set to zero

underestimate?
 
 A/R  -ADA  R/E
 456   192   
-202  -202
       110(accrue bad debt) 
 254   100

A/R -ADA R/E

## BASE Equation 
Beginning balance
+Additions
-Substractions
=Ending balance

## Aging Method
how long since they paid?

< 90 days    0.1%
over 90 days 1.0%


# Recitation 4
new recognition: works for bundles well, proportion
mathing principle: match all expenses to associated revenues
Allowance Accounts: estimate future expenses

We will focus today: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (ADA) & Bad Debt Expense (BDE)
ADA on Asset, BDE on I/S, everytime set up BDE, increase ADA
ADA works against A/R and represents our best estimate of uncollectible accounts
ADA decreases A/R and decreases total assets

underestimate doubtful accounts: new bad debt expense, expand ADA, decrease R/E
overestimate doubtful accounts: roll over extra ADA for future

# Allowance for Return Allowance
If customer has the right to return the product
stays on the Liability side, also functions to decrease A/R(much like ADA)

when return actually occurs, reduces ARA and A/R

# Take-away
allowing customers to buy on credit, generate higher revenues, but having risks of bad debts and returns

ADA, BDE, write-off
