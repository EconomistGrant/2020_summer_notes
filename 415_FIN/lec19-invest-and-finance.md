# Interaction between investment and financing
Value of unleveraged firm: (1-t)CF adjusted by WACC

MM II: rE = rA + D/E (rA - rD)
rA is independent of leverage, rE increase with D/E

# Leverage with tax shield - APV
VL = E + D = VU + PVTS - PVDC = APV

simplicity: ignore PVDC
VL = VU + PVTS = APV
a portfolio with an asset identical to the after tax project; an asset identical to tax shield

Further Assumptions:
constant leverage ratio over time -> rL is constant weighted average of rD and rE

APV/WACC approach on notes

# Implementing APV
Find a firm with same business risk -> D/E, rE, rD, tax rate -> rA, VU; PVTS -> APV
key: rA

# APV vs WACC
Pros of WACC
widely used, fewer computation, straight forward, easier to understand and explain
Cons of WACC
mixes up effects of assets and liabilities? errors in the effect of liabilities contaminate valuation
not flexible: non-constant debt ratio; hybrid securities; cost of distress; personal taxes

Pros of APV
no contamination, easier to track down value source, flexible to analysis
Cons
not widely used


Overall:
complex: APV
under right circumstances: indifference
