# MM relaxation
taxes
cost of financial distress

more on last lecture: asymmetric information, transaction cost...

# Tax 
transactions are taxed differently
interest: tax exempt | dividend/earnings taxable
financing affect tax bill

assume no personal taxes: pension funds investor

## Claim: Debt increases firm value by reducing tax burden
three slices of firm value: equity, debt, taxes
(1-t)(X - rD) + rD = (1-t)X + trD

*tax shield折旧用的是rD，风险对应，而不是cost of capital*

## MM I with Taxes
VL = VU + PVTS

Value can be created when recapitalization (retire equity with debt)
# Financial Distress
why not full debt?
Direct costs: bankruptcy costs, legal costs, oppurtunity costs

## Indirect 1: losing customers and suppliers demanding cash payment
## Indirect 2: Agency costs
motivating managers act in value-destroying ways
## Indirect 3: Debt overhang
shareholders: full investment cost, part of the payoff(in good state)
debt holders: no invest cost, part of the payoff (in bad state)

"tax" on investment for shareholders, reluctant to fund

# Overcoming Debt Overhang
## 1 New Debt
new debt with higher seniority: reduces tax on investment
often prohibited by covenants?

## 2 Financial Restructuring
Debt for Equity Exchange
Debt Rescheduling

## Ex ante
anticipation, least structure liabilities to restructure easily

# Trade-off Theory
## MM I extended
VL = VU + PV(tax shield) - PV (cost of financial distress)
optimal Value under leverage
流程：
1. state price
2. PV of tax shield, based on interest payment, state-price
3. PV of default cost

# Personal Tax
corporate tax rate t
tax rate on equity: pi
tax rate on debt: delta

VL = VU + [(1-delta) - (1-pi)(1-t)] PV(rD)
if equity ppi = delta
VL = VU + (1-delta)tPV(rD)

if capital gains tax can be avoided (pi = 0), when t < delta, negative tax shield 
*intuition: tax on firm level is smaller than personal level*
