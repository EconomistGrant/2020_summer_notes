# Mean-variance preferences
up, left

minimize total variantion subject to 1)total weight = 1 2) get expected return

# Two Assets
safe + risky: linear

# Portfolio Frontier with multiple risky assets
given a expected 
efficient frontier portfolios
optimization problem: P!
efficient frontier

# Portfolio frontier with a safe asset
regard portfolio as safe + risky 

risky asset frontier without safety asset
take tangent line passing the safe asset on the y-axis
tangent line -> frontier
Capital Market Line
Slope: the same and the best Sharpe Ratio = rp-rf / sigma

all mean-variance investors try to maximize the SR
every fund should hold the same proportion of risky asset: nonsense!
funds have different understanding of the distribution?

# Solving tangency portfolio
min 1/2 w^T SIGMA w
s.t w^T = m

SR_T^2 = \sum SR_i^2

# Individual contribution
marginal contribution: 
to return:
partial r_p / partial w_i = r_i - r_F
to variance: 2Cov(r_i, r_p)
