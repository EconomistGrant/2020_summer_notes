# Valuation: DCF
P/E for JPM, BAML, MS: 9 ~ 10
Discounted Cash Flow Model
P_t : expected stock price
D_t : expected cash dividevd
r+t : expected stock return

define:
1 + r_1 = (D_1 + P_1) / P_0
P_0 = (D_1 + P_1) / (1 + r_1)

$$
P_0 = \sum

$$
assume T->inf, P_T/(1+r)^T = 0 (no valuation bubbles)

# Gordon Model: Constant Growth Model
Dividend growth at rate g
P0 = D1 / (r-g)

r = (1+g)D0/P0 + g = dividend yield + expected dividend growth

# Multi-stage growth
Growth - Transition - Maturity

compute stock price at transition time, ...


# Forecasting dividend
Earnings (EPS)
Payout Ratio: DPS / EPS = p
Plowback ratio = b = 1 - p
Book Value Per Share_t = BVPS_t-1 + EPS_t * b

determine b by incremental revenue? expansion plan?

# Growth Opportunities and Growth Stocks
Present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) = P_0 - P_0_no_growth
growth stock: a firm with access to positive-NPV projects in the future

# Growth Opportunities and stock valuation
different P/E ratios: differences in growth opportunities

P0 = EPS1 / r + PVGO
if PVGO = 0 : P/E = 1/r
o/w: P/E = 1/r + PVGO/EPS1
# Valuation of an operating business
PV = sum FCF_t / (1+r)^t + PV_T / (1+r)^T

FCF = Earnings - Net Investment
PV(Business) = PV(FCF from years 1 to T) + PV(Horizon Value at T)

## Horizon value using multiples
in the long run, companies are very similar: 
say since yeare 5, we can apply P/E = 6
PV4 = Earnings5 * 6 -> PV0(PV4), present value of horizon value 
PV0(PV4) + PV (FCF from 1 to 4)

or estimate using P/B multiples, ...

or starting T = 5, PVGO converges to 0, so PV5 = Earnings6 / cost of capital 
(cant access to positive-NPV projects)
