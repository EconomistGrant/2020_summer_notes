# Payout Overview
payout policy + capital strucutre: major components of financial decisions
dividend cut -> price decline
stable payout policy -> prevent firm from profitable investment?

can firm add value by changing payout policy?
what factors determines optimal payout policy?

market reaction: prevent traditional investors / attract activist investors

# Payout Policy
Free Cash Flow - Retain (invest or increase cash reserves)
               - Payout (repurchase or dividend)

trade off depends on the efficiency of cash use: good use or misuse

## Dividends
regular and special
mechanics: declaration date; record date; ex-divident date (T+2, 2 days prior record date); cum-dividend date (trading date before ex-dividend date); distribution date(a month after record date, mail checks)

cun - ex - record

## Repurchases / buyback
retire or keep as treasury stock
mechanics:
1. open market repurchases (95%)
2. tender offer: 10% - 20% premium over current price, over pre-specified period (20 days?)
3. target repurchase: direct negotiation with a major shareholder

## Facts of dividends
widespread, 50% - 60% of after-tax profit, cash is the major form, repurchase becoming more popular
stable payout ratios, managers worry more about changes rather than levels, dividend policies precede other decisions!
3.7% at initiation, -7% at ommission

GM changed regular dividend only 8 times over 23-year 

level of stock repurchases is related to economy, but dividend level is not

## MM Irrelevancy on Dividends
Firm has value of 42$, 40 in asset and 2 in cash
will you prefer leave 2 in firm or in your pocket?

In MM world: it does not matter
no transaction cost, taxes, no friction
share price drops by the same amount after dividend is paid

## repurchase
using the same amount of dividends payment to buy back shares
share price unchanged!
earning per share increase, ...

## Conclusion
In perfect financial market, payout policy is irrelavant and does not affect its initial share price

# Beyond MM
"Birds-in-the-hand" dividends are safer than future payments, paying dividends increase firm value
taxes, signalling, agency problems...

## Dividend Tax vs Capital Gain Tax
shareholders: taxes on capital gains when selling shares / on receiving dividends
dividends tax: 70s, 70%; 80s, 40%; now, 20%

if tax rate on dividend is greator: dividend is worse
however the dividen tax reform increases the share repurchase.......
why?
## Dividend Puzzle
at corporate level, not tax exempt;
at personal level, taxed

Possible explanations:
transaction costs, signaling hypothesis, free cash flow hypothesis

## Signalling Hypothesis
signal good prospects through dividends
- firms know more about their own value (prospects)
- firm with prospects can afford to pay more
why not signal through repurchases?!

## Free CF Hypothesis
Excess cash lead to agency problems
prevents wasting money on bad projects

question: dividens are discretionary, interest payment on debt is a stronger commitment!

# Risk Management
Factor risk: commidity price, interest rates - Hedging
Idiosyncratic risk - Diversification, Insurance


risk management policy: transaction in the financial market to hedge exposure to factor risks
## MM extension
hedging has no impact on firm value if:
no taxes, no transacion costs in the financial market, equal assess to the market, information symmetry, no financial distress

intuition: managers cannot increase firm value, by making zero NPV transactions in the market
(hedging that stockholders can do themselves)

## Beyond MM
hedging if:
reduce tax, better oppurtunities than stockholders, better information, reduce financial distress, reduces agency costs

Vnet = Voriginal + (hedge ratio) * deltaVhedging

perfect hedging! completely hedge oil price risk for example

may not be perfect matching
maturity, contract size, underlying asset

# Hedge interest rate risk
Vp = Va + Vb
when interest rate changes, -(VaMDa + VbMDb) deltay
MDp = weigted average of MDs, weights are bond values

perfect hedge: MDp = 0 -> hedge ratio
what about interest futures?
