# Intro
look at liability side

what is the best source of funds?
internal funds, debt, equity, warrants, convertibles, other secs...

# Capital Structure
mix of financial claims against a firm's asset/cash flows
payoff strucutures, priority, maturity, covenants, voting rights, options, ...

Leverage = Debt / (D + E) = 0.5 in book, 0.25 in Market
market: going down in years, meaning the market value of equity is going up compared with book value

internal 80%, debt 30/5, equity -10%
macro forces of capital structure


# Discussion
Modigliani-Miller: capital structure is irrelevant
missing from MM? Tax, cost of debt, transaction costs, asymmetric info
"Textbook" view: tradeoff

# MM
complete financial market
market efficiency no asymmetric info, 
no tax, 
no transaction/bankruptcy costs
hold constant the firm's investment
->
## MM1
the choice of capital structure is irrelevant for firm value

Notations:

CF_A = CF_D + CF_E
PV_A = PV_D + PV_E
D + E = A

## pie theory: 
how a pie is sliced does not change the size of the pie
slicing: zero NPV activity

r_A = D/(D+E) r_D + E/(D+E) r_E = WACC

## Cheap debt fallacy
debt is better because it is cheaper (lower return <- safer)
hidden cost of capital:
raising debt makes equity riskier, wD -> rE
assume CAPM holds, beta_D = 0, beta_E = 1/(1-wD) beta_A

## MM II
cost of equity
r_E = r_A + D/E (rA - rD) (can change r with beta)

first term: business
second term: financial risk

bA = wDbD + (1-wD)bD
if beta_D = 0: beta_E = (1 + D/E) beta_A

in absense of taxes: only required rate of return on asset/project is needed
find traded firms with comparable business/asset, if 100% equity financed
if not: un-lever to get asset return

## Insights
Applies to all aspects of financial policy: a lot of things are irrelavant!

# Default risk
risk that a debt issuer fails to make promised payments
rating agency: Moody's and S&P
Gilt-edge: Aaa / AAA
Very high Aa/AA
Upper medium A / A
Lower Medium Baa / BBB
Low grade Ba / BB

no degree, only the likelihood of default

# Default premium and risk premium
promised YTM:     full payoff over market price
expected YTM: expected payoff over market price

**Default Premium = Promised YTM - Expected YTM**
intuition: default risk is not all idiosyncratic

**Risk Premium = expected YTM - risk-free YTM (default-free YTM)**

## Factors affecting default premium
p of default + financial loss in event of default

promised yield = (1+y) [(1-p) + p(1-lambda)]

## State Price approach
10 = 15price_u + 5price_d
1 / 1.05 = price_u + price_d
or risk-neutral approach!

state price -> current price of bond and stock
loss rate: (promised payoff - market price)/promised payoff
