# Historic asset returns and discount rates
rate of return = (dividend + uncertian future price - begin. price) / begin.price
expected rate of return
risk premium = expected rate of return - risk free rate

# Special Cash Flows: Annuities and Perpetuities
start at the end of period 1 to the end of T
PV = A/r * (1 - 1/(1+r)^T )

with growth rate g
PV = A/ (r - g) * (1 - [(1+g)/(1+r)]^T)

Perpetuity: annuity with infinite maturity
A/r or A/(r-g)

# Compounding
interest credited/charged more often than annually

Annual Percentage Rate (APR), k periods: 
interest per peirod APR/k
Effective Auural Rate (EPR) = (1 + r_APR/k) ^ k
k -> inf, EPR -> e^r, compound continuously

# Mortgage Calculation
20% Down payment, and borrow the rest from bank using property as collateral
fixed monthly payment 
have an option to prepay

400,000 = sum_t [M / (1 + APR / k) ^ t]

# Other Issues
Taxes
Currencies
Forecasting cash flows, not biased
Choosing the right discount rate: 
risk free interest rate (time value)
risk adjustment(risk premium)
