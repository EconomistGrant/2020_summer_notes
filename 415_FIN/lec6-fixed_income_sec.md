# Yield Curve
Cash Flows: 
fixed income sec
Maturity Principal; Coupon

Valuation: 1) relative, no arbitrage 2) without risk, time value of money 3) value riskless cash flows at hand?

time value is captured: spot interest rate; prices of discount bonds/coupon bonds

Spot interest rate: current interest rate for maturity date t: payments only on date t

yield curve (term structure of interset rates), spot interest rate for different maturities

# Discount bonds vs Coupon Bonds, Relative Bond Valuation
Prices of discount bonds -> spot interest rates -> prices of coupon bond (cash flow replication)

with prices of coupon bonds -> solve prices of discount bonds (essentially, discount rate) -> arbitrage oppurtunities?

# Yield to Maturity
(price)B = sum Ct / (1+y)^t + P / (1+y)^T

c = y iff B = 1
coupon rate = yield to maturity

two-year discount bond price does not dependent on r_1 because there is no cash flow in year 1
but it is dependent on r_2

holding everything equal, increase coupon -> increase YTM?
no. YTM is some sort of average of spot interest rate (discount rate) weighted by cash flows, so it depends on "weights" and the yield curve

# Yield Curve Dynamics
Expectation Hypothesis: the term structure reflects the market expectaitons of future short term rates
