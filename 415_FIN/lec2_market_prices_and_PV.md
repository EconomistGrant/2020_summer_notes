# Lecture 2 Market Prices and Present Value
# State-space model for time and risk
two dates: 0, 1 \
N possible economic states with probability \
the payoff at t = 1: random variable [(X_1, ..., X_N); (p_1, ...p_N)] \
P = the price at t0

## Arrow-Debreu Securities
pay $1 in a single state and nothing o/w  \
A-D claim on state j (the only state having payoff) \
price of A-D cliam: $\phi_j > 0$ given no arbitrage  \
complete maket: one can effectively trade A-D securities on each state \


# Arbitrage pricing and present value
X paying [3, 5] could be viewd as the portfolio of [1, 0] and [0, 1], given no arbitrage \
$P = 3 \phi_1 + 5 \phi_2$
