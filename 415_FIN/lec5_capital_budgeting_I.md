# Concepts
NPV rule
cash flows from capital investment
discount rates and projects interaction
alternative capital budgeting rules

# NPV rule
For single project: take it if and only if +NPV
For many independent projects: take all those with positive NPV
For mutually exclusive projects: take the one with positive and highest NPV

cash flow, discount rates, strategic options, ...

# Cash Flow Calculation
cash flows instead of acconting earnings, after-tax cash flows
incremental: attributable to the project only
no sunk cost
include investment in working capital as capital expenditure

CF = Project Cash Inflows - Project Cash Outflows
   = Operating Revenue - Operating Expenses without depr - Taxes - CapEx

   = (1-t) [Operating Profit] - [Capital Expenditures] + (t)[ Depreciation ]

   = Profit(after tax) - change in inventory (actually, working capital)


# Discount rate and project interaction
timimg: start project later, more "future PV" because competitors harder to copy, but you need to discount more, ...

# Alternative capital budgeting rules
alternative rules:
Payback Period
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Profitability Index(PI)

# PP
CF0+CF1+CF2 + ... CFs>= 0
accept if s is less than some fixed threshold
- no discounting, ignores cf after cutoff time

## IRR
discount rate that makes PV = 0
same decision as NPV rule if only one project is under consideration
- multiple IRR's! if cash sign changes (non-monotonic?)
- does not consider scale

## Profitability Index
PI = PV of future CFs / - CF0
take if: PI > 1
comparing: highest

same as NPV if: there is only one cash outflow at 0
only one project considered

- does not consider scale

# Additional considerations
1. Competitor response: CF should consider 
2. Capital Rationing, Maximize NPV with maximum total I
3. Source of positive-NPV:
   short-run competitive advantage
   long-run competitive advantage, patent, technology, economies of scale, ...
