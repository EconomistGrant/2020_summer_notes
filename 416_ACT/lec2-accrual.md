Accounting performance
Stock price/volume/liquidity
Managers reputations/compensation

# Balance Sheet Equation, BSE
Assets = Liability + Shareholders’ Equity (book value/net worth/residual claim)

Cash + A/R + Inv. = A/P + Bonds + CC + R.E

## Assets
1. right of ownership
2. associated with future benefits
3. measurable with reasonable accuracy
## Liability
1. result of past transaction
2. future obligation - cash, good or service
3. measuable with reasonable accuracy
## Shareholders' Equity
residual cliamant to the firm's assets
devide rights into: contributed capital + retained earnings
CC: issurance of stock
RE: profits not distyribuited as dividends

Expenses: outflows of cash that are incuured to generate revenues
Gains: inflows of assets are not generated through the ordinary course of business (sell of headquaters, for eg)
Losses: outflow of ...

*End. RE = Beg. RE + Net Income - Dividend*

# Principles of Accrual Accouting
measure firm performance regardless of when cash is exchanged
