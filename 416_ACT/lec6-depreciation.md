# Before class
HF criticizes Tesla with increasing A/R collection time

record aquisition: -cash, +equip
not yet used to generate revenues, not in the I/S

how to account for cost? what about selling the asset?

# useful life and salvage value
u/l:time period over which asset will be used, not the same as physical life
s/v:estimate of value at disposal

boh estimates require managerial judgment

# straight-line & accelerated depreciation
(acquisition price - salvation value) / useful life
in each year: +accunulated depr.(contra. accout), +depr. expenses

change of policy: calculate remaining useful life, salvage value, net book value

# Gain or Loss on Disposal of PPE
1. Record Cash of the market value receiced
2. Record disposal of the asset by removing the cost of the asset
3. Remove accum. depr.
4. Calculated gain/loss by Cash - (Cost - accum. depr.) = Gain/Loss

# Impairment Loss
+ Accum. Depr - RE (Impairment Loss)
