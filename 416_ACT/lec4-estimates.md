# The Role of Estimates
customer does not pay: expense that should be matched to revenues
bad debt expense

# Apollo's business model
Joe not paying bills: reduce receivables on B/S
record an expense on I/S

accrual accounting says the "bad debt expenses" should be matched to the date of revenue

# Two methods of estimation
percentage of sales method
aging method: based on the age of the receivables (longer, less likely)

## Percentage of sales
revenue expenses
4% allowance expense 
write off (-A/R, -Allowance)

## BASE Equation

+Additions
-Substractions
=Ending balance

## Aging Method
how long since they paid?

< 90 days    0.1%
over 90 days 1.0%
